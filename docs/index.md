# PiSniffer Documentation

Ethernet, despite being a relatively old connector/bus, is still ubiquitous in
modern computing. While Wi-Fi has grown in popularity and become faster and
more secure over time, Ethernet is still the networking connection of choice
when users want maximum speed and reliability. Additionally, from a security
perspective, Ethernet is much more desirable: there are no powerful observable
radio waves traveling freely through space that any regular device can see if
correctly configured. Instead, to "sniff" on Ethernet lines, you must be
somehow inserted in between two devices you want to listen in on. So, for our
ECE 4180 final project, we decided to learn a bit more about how you might
build such a device. Below is a documentation of our methodology, our process,
and our results.

After all was said and done, we wound up with a breadboard that contained both
the mbed side of our demo as well as the Pi side of our demo:
